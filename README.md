## Note: Would really appreciate some help with increasing the performance of the duplication checker function. Right now that function single handedly slows down the program by a lot. 

## NLPulse

This Python-based project is designed to analyze sentiment from news articles fetched via RSS feeds, store the sentiment data in a SQLite database, and visualize the results using interactive dashboards. The project combines multiple natural language processing (NLP) models and libraries to ensure a robust sentiment analysis pipeline, providing an overview of sentiment trends across different days, times, and topics.

### Key Features

- **RSS News Fetching**: Pulls news articles from an RSS feed (default: Times of India Top Stories).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of each news article using a combination of three sentiment analysis techniques:
  - **VADER**: A rule-based model for general sentiment analysis.
  - **FinBERT**: A transformer model designed specifically for financial sentiment analysis.
  - **RoBERTa**: A transformer model pre-trained on Twitter data, fine-tuned for sentiment.
- **Summarization**: Long news articles are summarized before sentiment analysis using the **BART** summarization model.
- **Data Storage**: Sentiment results, along with article metadata, are stored in an SQLite database for future analysis.
- **Visualizations**: A comprehensive dashboard is generated with multiple plots to visualize sentiment trends over time.

## Project Structure

- **Cell 1**: Contains the necessary imports and setup. Libraries like NLTK, transformers, and Plotly are used.
- **Cell 2**: Defines the `SentimentAnalyzer` class for performing sentiment analysis using multiple models and summarizing long texts.
- **Cell 3**: Implements the `DatabaseManager` class, which handles database operations such as storing, cleaning, and deduplicating news entries.
- **Cell 4**: Creates visualizations of the data using the `DataVisualizer` class, which generates an interactive dashboard.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure that the required libraries are installed:

```bash
!pip install feedparser TextBlob
!pip install nltk transformers torch wordcloud plotly
```

Libraries used:
- `feedparser`: For fetching and parsing RSS feeds.
- `nltk`: For natural language processing, including sentiment analysis using VADER.
- `transformers`: Hugging Face library for FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BART models.
- `torch`: For handling neural networks and models like BERT/Roberta.
- `wordcloud`: For generating word clouds.
- `plotly`: For creating interactive visualizations.
- `sqlite3`: Built-in Python library for managing a SQLite database.


## Operation Flow

1. **Fetching News**:
    - The program fetches news articles from the specified RSS feed (default: Times of India).
    - For each news article, the article's title and summary are retrieved along with the published date and time.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    - Each article's summary is processed using three models:
      - **VADER**: General-purpose rule-based sentiment analysis model.
      - **FinBERT**: Transformer model fine-tuned for financial sentiment.
      - **RoBERTa**: Transformer model tuned for social media sentiment.
    - Each model generates a sentiment score between 0 and 10, which is combined into a weighted average score.

3. **Storing Results**:
    - The sentiment scores and article details (date, time, title, summary) are stored in a SQLite database.
    - A cleanup process is run on the database to remove redundant or incomplete entries.

4. **Visualization**:
    - Data is retrieved from the database, and an interactive dashboard is generated using Plotly.
    - Various plots display sentiment trends, daily distributions, hourly patterns, and topic-specific sentiment analysis.

## Database Structure

The SQLite database `news_sentiment.db` stores the following fields in the `sentiment_scores` table:

- `date`: The publication date of the news article (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format).
- `time`: The publication time (in `HH:MM:SS` format).
- `title`: The title of the news article.
- `summary`: A summarized version of the article, used for sentiment analysis.
- `score`: The sentiment score of the article (on a scale of 0 to 10).

## Visualizations

The dashboard generated includes several interactive plots:

### 1. **Sentiment Timeline**
   - A time-series line chart that shows the daily average sentiment score.
   - This plot helps in tracking overall sentiment trends over time.

### 2. **Daily Distribution**
   - A histogram displaying the distribution of sentiment scores.
   - It shows how often different sentiment scores (0 to 10) appear in the dataset.

### 3. **Sentiment by Day of Week**
   - A bar plot displaying the average sentiment score for each day of the week.
   - Helps identify trends like whether sentiment tends to be higher or lower on certain days (e.g., weekends vs. weekdays).

### 4. **Hourly Patterns**
   - A line chart showing sentiment scores by hour of the day.
   - Reveals whether sentiment tends to fluctuate based on the time articles are published.

### 5. **Word Cloud**
   - A word cloud generated from the summaries of all news articles.
   - Displays frequently occurring words, giving a quick sense of the most discussed topics.

### 6. **Topic Analysis**
   - A bar plot that shows the average sentiment score across different predefined topics (e.g., Politics, Economy, Health, Technology, Sports).
   - This analysis is based on the presence of specific keywords in the article summaries.

## How to Run

To run the program, simply execute the `main()` function, which will:

1. Fetch news articles from the RSS feed.
2. Analyze each articleâ€™s sentiment.
3. Store results in the SQLite database.
4. Clean the database of duplicates and incomplete records.
5. Generate and display an interactive dashboard for further analysis.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Customization

- **RSS Feed URL**: To change the source of news, replace the `NEWS_FEED_URL` variable with the desired RSS feed URL.
- **Database**: The name of the SQLite database is controlled by the `DATABASE_NAME` constant and can be modified as needed.
- **Visualization Customization**: Modify the `DataVisualizer` class to adjust plots, add new analyses, or include additional data sources.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Topic Classification**: Implement machine learning models to classify news articles into topics more accurately.
- **Extended Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate more advanced sentiment analysis techniques, including multilingual support.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Integrate real-time news feeds for continuous analysis and automatic updates.
